# SpringblockUI
A standard UI for the Springblock blockchain networks to allow trading across multiple blockchain technologies

This is a temporary repository so that a few people can work on getting it up and running before we move it to the main repository on the Springblock project

In order to get it running:

1. Clone the poject
2. cd to the Project folder
3. do an npm install
4. run `webpack` to build
5. npm start

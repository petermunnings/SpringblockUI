# SpringblockUI
A standard UI for the Springblock blockchain networks to allow issuance and trading from a common interface.  This will allow a simple comparison of the performance and functionality of multiple blockchain technologies

This is a temporary repository so that a few people can work on getting it up and running before we move it to the main repository on the Springblock project

In order to get it running:
## Setup the project

1. Clone the poject
2. cd to the Project folder
3. do an npm install

## Start the test api

1. cd test_api
2. npm start

## Start the main project

1. Open a new terminal
2. cd back to the Project folder
3. npm start

Open a browser and go to http://localhost:3000
